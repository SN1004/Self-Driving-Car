# Self-Driving-Car

In this project focused on Autonomous Vehicles, with a primary focus on lane changing and object detection, I am delving into the dynamic realm of modern transportation technology. Leveraging the power of Unity3D, a versatile game engine, and the innovative ML-Agents library tailored for machine learning in Unity, this endeavor seeks to bridge the gap between virtual simulation and real-world application.

The heart of this project lies in its exploration of the intricate challenges presented by autonomous lane changing and robust object detection. By harnessing Unity3D's immersive simulation capabilities, I am able to replicate real-world scenarios within a controlled environment. The ML-Agents library further empowers this simulation with adaptive machine learning, facilitating the training of intelligent agents for optimal decision-making.

A significant facet of this undertaking involves experimenting with an array of hyperparameter configurations. By systematically varying these parameters, I aim to unearth the most effective settings for enhancing vehicle autonomy and safety during lane changes, while refining object detection accuracy.

The project unfolds with simulations across diverse tracks, each presenting unique intricacies. Through these varied scenarios, I am working towards not only honing autonomous driving capabilities but also contributing to the broader field of transportation technology. As the project progresses, the aim is to develop advanced models capable of making informed lane-changing decisions while exhibiting impeccable object detection acumen, thus contributing to the ongoing evolution of autonomous vehicles.
